--- The tablet used to open on a raw keyboard scan of the T key, read every frame
--- from the manager's update. That is not a binding: it could not be rebound, it
--- never appeared in Controls, and it fired whatever else T was doing, which on
--- this map is chat plus two other mods. It now goes through a real InputAction
--- registered in the player context, which the game binds, lists and lets the
--- player change.
---
--- The old scan symbols are deliberately not quoted anywhere in this file, so a
--- plain search for them across the packed mod comes back empty.
